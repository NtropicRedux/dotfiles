2021-05-07 00:16:16	Metamorphosis	Hello. Is it better to format external(portable) hard disks to Fat32 instead of the default NTFS to use on Linux?

2021-05-07 01:02:46	ksynwa	Hello. This is a dumb question so sorry about this. I have only used a rolling distro so I don't know about this. What are some differences between Ubuntu 21.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 for a normie end-user? I saw that 21.04 has a newer kernel which is nice. What else is different?

2021-05-07 01:05:21	-->	tans994 has joined #ubuntu
2021-05-07 01:05:43	guiverc	ksynwa, 21.04 contains packages that were available prior to the UI & like freezes for 2021-April release (look up schedule for dates), 20.04 prior to the 2020-April release... LTS or 20.04 release offers two kernel stacks, GA or HWE so you have two options for kernel modules (ie. drivers), HWE currently is 20.10 stack but will soon move to 21.04 stack; GA = original 20.04 kernel but that's not end-user packages
2021-05-07 01:06:08	-->	Gee19 has joined #ubuntu
2021-05-07 01:07:36	guiverc	summary, LTS is software that existed before 2020-April & remains that way... non-LTS release uses software that's generally up to 6 months old (software that existed prior to it's release)

2021-05-07 01:14:13	-->	overfiend has joined #ubuntu
2021-05-07 01:15:15	guiverc	ksynwa, LTS is 5 years for 'main' software, 3 years generally for 'universe' for security fixes etc... non-LTS is 9 months so release-upgrades are required every 6-9 months (benefit being always newer software)
2021-05-07 01:17:14	guiverc	LTS releases usually have LTS releases of software (due to longer supported life, so may not be the latest version that is packaged unless that was also a LTS release of program (libreoffice etc)
