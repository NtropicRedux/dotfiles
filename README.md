# dotfiles

Collection of my dotfiles, redacted where necessary.

## Overview

Most of these files are symlinked into this repository so that I don't have to constantly copy
the source files whenever I make changes.  I don't think this will effect anything on your
filesystem if when cloning this repository, but I haven't tested that so I may be wrong.

For now it's better to just copy the raw files from the web browser and bookmark the repository
for reference.  If it turns out to be problematic, I'll setup a script to copy the files over
instead.
